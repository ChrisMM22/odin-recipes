        <h2><u>What are empanadas ?</u></h2>

        <p>Empanadas are very popular snacks in Colombia, they are found almost everywhere,
            from cafes to restaurant, and even food stools. It is a fried pastry that contains filling
            such as, potatoes, onions, peppers, chicken, beef, or pork. For this guide we will be 
            using chicken and beef. I also strongly recommend to serve them with

        <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the dough:Place the masarepa in a large bowl. Add the sazon Goya and salt and stir to mix well. Add the water and oil and mix to form dough. Pat the dough into a ball and knead for 2 minutes or until smooth. Cover with plastic and set aside for 20 minutes.</li><br />
            <li>Meanwhile, to make the filling, cook the potatoes in a pot with water and the bouillon tablet for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain and gently mash the potatoes. Set aside.</li><br />
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, green onions, garlic, bell pepper, cilantro, salt and black pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes</li><br />
            <li>Add the ground pork and beef. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture is fairly dry</li><br />
            <li>Transfer the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes bowl and mix well to combine</li><br />
            <li>Break small portions of the dough, about 1 ½ tablespoons each one, and form each portion into a ball by rolling between the palms of your hands</li><br />
            <li>Place the balls of dough between two pieces of plastic and roll each out very thinly to form a circle. Remove the top plastic and place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each</li><br />
            <li>Then using the plastic underneath, fold the dough over to enclose the filling, forming a half circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork</li><br />
            <li>Fill a large pot with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat to 360° F</li><br />
            <li>Carefully place 3 or 4 empanadas at the time in the heated oil and fry for about 2 minutes until golden on all sides</li><br />
            <li>Using a slotted spoon transfer the empanadas to a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with ají and lime on the side</li>
        </ol>
